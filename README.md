Pink Panther is a light framework that programatically checks for biased language in a code repository.

This repo includes the GitHub Action that other GitHub projects will call on. If you are looking for the main code repository or the Dockerfile that builds the `biased_lang` image, please visit [http://go/pinkpanther](http://go/pinkpanther).

# Quickstart

1. If your project doesn't have a GitHub Actions workflow, follow steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow) to create one.

2. Copy the job below into your `.github/workflows/` yml file as a job.

```sh
biased_lang:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Detecting Biased Language
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - id: pink-panther
        uses: splunk/pink-panther@main
        with:
          token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

3. Commit your changes

    When you merge this biased language stage into your GitHub Actions for the first time, look for a job named `Detecting Biased Language` in any pipelines triggered.

Congratulations! Pink Panther is ready to use in GitHub Actions
